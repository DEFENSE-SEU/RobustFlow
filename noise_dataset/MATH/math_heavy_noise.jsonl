{"problem": "so like, imagine this convex pentagon, right? it's got two angles that are congruent and, like, acute (super sharp). And get this, each of the other angles inside is equal to the total of those two acute ones—kinda neat, huh? We’re totally sticking with degrees here, just so ya know. So, what’s the common measure of those larger angles, in degrees? 🤔", "level": "Level 5", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \\[\nx+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \\implies 8x = 540 \\implies x=135/2.\n\\] The large angles each measure $2x=\\boxed{135}$ degrees."}

{"problem": "so like, check it out: we got A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, all the way to Z = 26, right? The whole product thing for a word is just the product of its letter values. For instance, take CAB — it’s got a product value of 3 $\\times$ 1 $\\times$ 2 = 6, you feel? Now, here’s the kicker: what common English word, like, has a product value of 715? Oh, and it doesn’t even have to be 3 letters long, just sayin’. 🤔", "level": "Level 5", "type": "Prealgebra", "solution": "Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\\cdot11\\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \\begin{align*}\n(5)\\cdot (11) \\cdot (13) &= 5\\cdot 11\\cdot 13 \\\\\n(5\\cdot11)\\cdot 13&=55\\cdot 13 \\\\\n5\\cdot(11\\cdot 13) &= 5\\cdot 143 \\\\\n(5\\cdot 13) \\cdot 11 &= 65 \\cdot 11\\text{, and}\\\\\n(5\\cdot11\\cdot13)&=715,\n\\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.

The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.
