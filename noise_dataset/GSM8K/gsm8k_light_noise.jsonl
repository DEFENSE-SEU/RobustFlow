{"question": "So, like, Carol and Jennifer are these sisters from Los Angeles who totally love collecting celeb signatures, right? During their summer break from school, they spend every afternoon going after those autographs. After five weeks, they sit down to compare their books, counting how many each has collected. Carol's got 20 signatures in her book, while Jennifer's sitting at 44. They've got three more weeks of summer vacation left, and they’re aiming for 100 signatures together by the end. So, how many more signatures do the sisters need to collect to hit that goal? 😊", "answer": "36", "cot": "Carol and Jennifer have already collected 20 + 44 signatures = <<20+44=64>>64 signatures.\nSince their goal is 100, they need to collect 100 - 64 signatures. 100 - 64 = <<100-64=36>>36 signatures", "id": "gsm8k-test-677"}
