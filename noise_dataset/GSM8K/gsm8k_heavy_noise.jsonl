{"question": "So like, Carol and Jennifer, you know, those sisters from LA, are totally obsessed with collectin' celebs' signatures, right? 😊 During their summer break from school, they’re out there every afternoon just grindin' for those autographs! After 5 weeks of this signature hunt, they finally sit down and compare their books. Carol's got 20 signatures, and Jennifer's sittin' pretty with 44, like wow! They’ve still got 3 more weeks of summer left and, like, they wanna hit **100** signatures together by the end of it — super ambitious, huh? So, like, how many more signatures do they need to collect to hit that goal? 🤔", "answer": "36", "cot": "Carol and Jennifer have already collected 20 + 44 signatures = <<20+44=64>>64 signatures.\nSince their goal is 100, they need to collect 100 - 64 signatures. 100 - 64 = <<100-64=36>>36 signatures", "id": "gsm8k-test-677"}
{"question": "So, like, there’s this team of 4 painters, right?

{"question": "So like, it’s gonna cost $194 per meter to, ya know, repave a street, right? And Monica’s street is, like, a solid 150 meters long — not too shabby! But then there’s Lewis’ street, which is, uh, way longer at 490 meters!

{"question": "Alright, so like, Richard is chillin' in this apartment building, right?? And it’s got 15 floors, which is kinda tall!! Each floor has, like, 8 units, ya know? But here’s the tea: 3/4 of the whole building is, like, occupied, which means there’s some empty spots too!!! So, um, what’s the total number of unoccupied units in the building? 🤔", "answer": "30", "cot": "The total number of units in the building will be 8 units/floor * 15 floors = <<8*15=120>>120 units.\nIf 3/4 of the building is occupied, then the total number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 units = <<3/4*120=90>>90 units.\nThe total number of unoccupied units is 120 units - 90 units = <<120-90=30>>30 units.", "id": "gsm8k-test-49"}
