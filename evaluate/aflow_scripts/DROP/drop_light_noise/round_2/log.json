        "question": "Passage: The Ogaden War was a Somali military offensive between July 1977 and March 1978 over the disputed Ethiopian region Ogaden starting with the Somali Democratic Republic's invasion of Ethiopia. The Soviet Union disapproved of the invasion and ceased its support of Somalia to instead start supporting Ethiopia, whereas the United States conversely ceased its support of Ethiopia and started supporting Somalia. Ethiopia was saved from a major defeat and a permanent loss of territory due to a massive airlift of military supplies , the arrival of 16,000 Cuban troops, 1,500 Soviet advisors and 2 brigades from South Yemen, also airlifted to reinforce Harar. The Ethiopians prevailed at Harar, Dire Dawa, Jijiga and began to push the Somalis out of the Ogaden systematically. By March 1978, the Ethiopians had captured almost all of the Ogaden, prompting the defeated Somalis to give up their claim to the region. With 1/3 of the initial Somali National Army invasion force killed and 1/2 of the Somali Airforce destroyed, the war left Somalia with a disorganized and demoralized army and an angry population. All of these conditions led to a revolt in the army which eventually spiraled into a civil war and Somalia's current situation.\nQuestion: Was more of the initial Somali National Army forc3 killed or were more of the Somali Air-force destroyd?\nAnswer:",
