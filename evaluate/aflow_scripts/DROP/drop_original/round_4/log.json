New England would come right back with Brady's 14-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Randy Moss.  Baltimore would play some catch-up in the fourth quarter as Flacco found running back Willis McGahee on a 13-yard touchdown pass, but the Patriots willingly replied with Gostkowski's 33-yard field goal.

After another victory at Giannitsa  on 2 November  1912, the Ottoman commander Hasan Tahsin Pasha surrendered Thessaloniki and its garrison of 26,000 men to the Greeks on 9 November  1912. Two Corps HQs , two Nizamiye divisions  and four Redif divisions  were thus lost to the Ottoman order of battle.

The Ottoman forces estimated that 15,000 officers and men had been killed during the campaign in south Macedonia, bringing total losses up to 41,000 soldiers.Another direct consequence was that the destruction of the Macedonian Army sealed the fate of the Ottoman Vardar Army, which was fighting the Serbs to the north.

At the time, the Habsburg King Ferdinand I of Bohemia  immediately rejected the agreement; nevertheless, in 1675 the \"Great Elector\" Frederick William of Brandenburg laid claim to the Silesian principalities when, with the death of Duke George William of Liegnitz, the Piast line ended. In 1603, Hohenzollern Elector Joachim III Frederick of Brandenburg also inherited the Silesian Duchy of Jägerndorf from his cousin, Margrave George Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach. After the Bohemian Revolt and the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, however, the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II confiscated the possessions of the Protestant Hohenzollerns in his Bohemian lands in 1621 after winning the Battle of White Mountain. The Electors of Brandenburg continued, nevertheless, to assert themselves as the legitimate rulers of Jägerndorf. Brandenburg, however, was unable to enforce these dynastic territorial claims. In 1685, when Austria was engaged in the Great Turkish War, Emperor Leopold I gave Elector Frederick William immediate control of the Silesian exclave of Schwiebus in return for military support against the Turks and the surrender of the outstanding Hohenzollern claims in Silesia. However, after the accession of the Elector's son and successor, Frederick III of Brandenburg, the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus in 1694, asserting that the territory had only been personally assigned to the late Frederick William for life. Furious, Frederick III in turn reasserted the old Hohenzollern claims to Jägerndorf and the Silesian Piast heritage.\nQuestion: How many years before Austria was engaged in the Great Turkish War was the battle of white mountain won?\nAnswer:",

        "question": "Passage: The country's economic transformation was far from complete. Political and financial crises in 1997, shattered the Czech Republic's image as one of the most stable and prosperous of post-Communist states. Delays in enterprise restructuring and failure to develop a well-functioning capital market played major roles in Czech economic troubles, which culminated in a currency crisis in May. The formerly pegged currency was forced into a floating system as investors sold their Korunas faster than the government could buy them. This followed a worldwide trend to divest from developing countries that year. Investors also worried the republic's economic transformation was far from complete. Another complicating factor was the current account deficit, which reached nearly 8% of GDP. In response to the crisis, two austerity packages were introduced later in the spring , which cut government spending by 2.5% of GDP. Growth dropped to 0.3% in 1997, −2.3% in 1998, and −0.5% in 1999. The government established a restructuring agency in 1999 and launched a revitalization program - to spur the sale of firms to foreign companies. Key priorities included accelerating legislative convergence with EU norms, restructuring enterprises, and privatising banks and utilities. The economy, fueled by increased export growth and investment, was expected to recover by 2000.\nQuestion: How many percentage points did GDP growth drop from 1997 to 1999?\nAnswer:",

About 1.1% used all other forms of transportation, including taxicab, motorcycle, and bicycle. About 6.7% of working Nashville residents worked at home. In 2015, 7.9% of city of Nashville households were without a car; this figure decreased to 5.9% in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Nashville averaged 1.72 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8 per household.\nQuestion: How many less Nashville residents worked at home than were without a car?\nAnswer:",

        "model_output": "Your review of the answers is mostly accurate, but there are a few clarifications and corrections needed regarding the interpretation of the data.\n\n1. **Percentage of residents working at home**: You correctly stated that 6.7% of working Nashville residents work at home.\n\n2. **Percentage of households without a car**: You also correctly noted that 5.9% of Nashville households are without a car.\n\nYour hypothetical calculation using 100,000 working residents and 100,000 households is a valid approach for simplifying the numbers. \n\n- **Residents working at home**: 6.7% of 100,000 = 6,700 residents.\n- **Households without a car**: 5.9% of 100,000 = 5,900 households.\n\nThe difference calculation is also correct:\n\n- **Difference**: 6,700 (working at home) - 5,900 (without a car) = 800.\n\nHowever, the conclusion needs to be clarified. You stated, \"there are **800 more residents working at home than there are households without a car**, not fewer.\" This is correct, but it is important to emphasize that the original question asked how many fewer residents worked at home than were without a car. \n\nSince the number of residents working at home (6,700) is greater than the number of households without a car (5,900), the answer to the original question is that there are **not fewer residents working at home; instead, there are 800 more residents working at home than there are households without a car**. \n\nIn summary, your calculations are accurate, but the interpretation of the question should clearly state that there are more residents working at home, not fewer.",
